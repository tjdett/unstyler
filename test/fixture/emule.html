This test data was extracted from http://www.emule-project.net/ on
23 November 2013. It differs from modern Word HTML by using upper-case HTML
tags.

Also interesting is that it has list items, so it may have been partially
converted to real HTML at some point in the distant past.

It serves as an example of ugly HTML from a different source than Word 2013.

<P><B>What is eMule?</B><BR>
  At dawn of &nbsp;May 13th 2002 a guy called Merkur was dissatisfied with the 
  original eDonkey2000 client and was convinced he could do better. So he did. He 
  gathered other developers around him, and eMule Project was born. Their aim was 
  to put the client back on track where eDonkey had been famous before, adding 
  tons of new features and a nice GUI. They couldn't imagine what impact this 
  decision would have...
  <o:p></o:p></P>
<P>As of today, eMule is one of the biggest and most reliable peer-to-peer file 
  sharing clients around the world. Thanks to it's open source policy many 
  developers are able to contribute to the project, making the network more 
  efficient with each release.
  <o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B>What does eMule mean?</B><BR>
  The name "eMule" comes from an animal called "Mule" which is somehow similar to 
  a donkey ;)
  <o:p></o:p></P>
<P><B>How often is eMule updated?</B><BR>
  eMule is not updated regularly, but at the moment the frequencies are between 1 
  and 3 months. Don't take this for guaranteed. :)
